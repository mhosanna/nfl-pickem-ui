<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run this project locally.

### Prerequisites

To run locally, you will first need to spin up the [nfl-pickem-edge](https://github.com/mhosanna/nfl-pickem-edge)

You will also need to create an account so you can log in to the front-end. Instructions for this can be found in the edge readme.

Once that is running, go to `config.ts` and make sure the `endpoint` variable matches the endpoint where your graphql schema is available from the edge.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mhosanna/nfl-pickem-ui.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Enter the season in the `config.ts` file
   ```js
   export const season = {{season_year}};
   ```
4. Spin it up
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### üèà Creating Games
To start game play, a player will create a week and add the games to be played that week. 
1. Go to the Manage Games page
2. Click the tile to add a new week.
3. Once you have defined the first week, click into its tile.
4. From there you can add each game that will be played that week. 
5. You will enter the home team, away team, and the spread of the game. Spreads can be grabbed from the sports betting site of your choice. I use [Bet MGM](https://sports.betmgm.com/en/sports). 

### üé≤ Making Picks
Once the games have been defined, players can log into their accounts and make their picks.
1. Go to the My Picks page.
2. Players can click the team they think will win with the spread.

To see other player's picks, go to Picks & Results. You can see each player's picks, or each game's picks.

### üèÜ Declaring Winners
After the real games have been played, a player will declare which team won the matchup.
1. Go to the Manage Games page.
2. Click into the current week and see the list of games.
3. Click on the team that won the match up. 

Each player's winning picks will be automatically calculated and the Leaderboard will be updated.
